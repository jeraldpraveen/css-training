    <h1>Kingdom Of Denmark</h1>
    <p id="first-para">
      Denmark (Danish: Danmark, pronounced [ˈtænmɑk] (listen)) is a Nordic
      country in Northern Europe. It is the most populous and politically
      central constituent of the Kingdom of Denmark,[N 12] a constitutionally
      unitary state that includes the autonomous territories of the Faroe
      Islands and Greenland in the North Atlantic Ocean.[17] European Denmark[N
      3] is the southernmost of the Scandinavian countries, lying southwest of
      Sweden, south of Norway,[N 13] and north of Germany. Spanning a total area
      of 42,943 km2 (16,580 sq mi),[9] it consists of the peninsula of Jutland
      and an archipelago of 443 named islands,[18] of which the largest are
      Zealand, Funen and the North Jutlandic Island. Denmark's geography is
      characterised by flat, arable land, sandy coasts, low elevation, and a
      temperate climate. As of 2022, it had a population of 5.88 million (1
      March 2022), of which 800,000 live in the capital and largest city,
      Copenhagen.[19] Denmark exercises hegemonic influence in the Danish Realm,
      devolving powers to handle internal affairs. Home rule was established in
      the Faroe Islands in 1948 and in Greenland in 1979; the latter obtained
      further autonomy in 2009. The unified kingdom of Denmark emerged in the
      eighth century as a proficient maritime power amid the struggle for
      control of the Baltic Sea.[7]

      In 1397, it joined Norway and Sweden to form the Kalmar Union, which
      persisted until the latter's secession in 1523. The remaining Kingdom of
      Denmark–Norway endured a series of wars in the 17th century that resulted
      in further territorial cessions to the Swedish Empire. Following the
      Napoleonic Wars, Norway was absorbed into Sweden, leaving Denmark with the
      Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Iceland. A surge of nationalist movements in
      the 19th century were defeated in the First Schleswig War of 1848, though
      the Second Schleswig War of 1864 resulted in further territorial losses to
      Prussia. The period saw the adoption of the Constitution of Denmark on 5
      June 1849, ending the absolute monarchy that was established in 1660 and
      introducing the current parliamentary system.
