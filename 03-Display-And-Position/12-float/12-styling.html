          Denmark (Danish: Danmark, pronounced [ˈtænmɑk] (listen)) is a Nordic
          country in Northern Europe. It is the most populous and politically
          central constituent of the Kingdom of Denmark,[N 12] a
          constitutionally unitary state that includes the autonomous
          territories of the Faroe Islands and Greenland in the North Atlantic
          Ocean.[17] European Denmark[N 3] is the southernmost of the
          Scandinavian countries, lying southwest of Sweden, south of Norway,[N
          13] and north of Germany. Spanning a total area of 42,943 km2 (16,580
          sq mi),[9] it consists of the peninsula of Jutland and an archipelago
          of 443 named islands,[18] of which the largest are Zealand, Funen and
          the North Jutlandic Island. Denmark's geography is characterised by
          flat, arable land, sandy coasts, low elevation, and a temperate
          climate. As of 2022, it had a population of 5.88 million (1 March
          2022), of which 800,000 live in the capital and largest city,
          Copenhagen.[19] Denmark exercises hegemonic influence in the Danish
          Realm, devolving powers to handle internal affairs. Home rule was
          established in the Faroe Islands in 1948 and in Greenland in 1979; the
          latter obtained further autonomy in 2009. The unified kingdom of
          Denmark emerged in the eighth century as a proficient maritime power
          amid the struggle for control of the Baltic Sea.[7]
